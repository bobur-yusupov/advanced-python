# Project Structure Documentation

This project is organized to provide a scalable and maintainable FastAPI application. Below is an overview of the directory structure and the purpose of each main component:

```text
app/
	__init__.py
	main.py
	core/
		__init__.py
		config.py
		security.py
	items/
		__init__.py
		api.py
		models.py
		services.py
	users/
		__init__.py
		api.py
		models.py
		services.py
	utils/
		__init__.py
		helpers.py
tests/
	__init__.py
	items/
		__init__.py
		test_api.py
	users/
		__init__.py
		test_api.py
```

## Directory and File Descriptions

- **app/**: Main application package.
	- **main.py**: Entry point for the FastAPI application.
	- **core/**: Core settings and security logic.
		- `config.py`: Configuration settings (e.g., environment variables, app settings).
		- `security.py`: Security utilities (e.g., authentication, password hashing).
	- **items/**: Business logic and API for items.
		- `api.py`: API routes for item-related endpoints.
		- `models.py`: Pydantic models and/or ORM models for items.
		- `services.py`: Service layer for item operations.
	- **users/**: Business logic and API for users.
		- `api.py`: API routes for user-related endpoints.
		- `models.py`: Pydantic models and/or ORM models for users.
		- `services.py`: Service layer for user operations.
	- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.
		- `helpers.py`: General helper functions used across the app.
- **tests/**: Test suite for the application (unit, integration, etc.).

## How to Extend

- Add new features by creating additional modules (e.g., `orders/`) following the same pattern as `items/` and `users/`.
- Place shared logic in `core/` or `utils/` as appropriate.

This structure encourages separation of concerns, modularity, and ease of testing.
